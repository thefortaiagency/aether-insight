## Setting Environment Variables in Vercel

1. Go to your project dashboard in Vercel
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add each variable listed above with your actual values
4. Make sure to select the appropriate environment(s):
   - Production
   - Preview
   - Development

## Cloudflare Stream Setup

1. Sign up for Cloudflare Stream at https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. Get your Account ID from the Cloudflare dashboard
3. Generate an API token with Stream:Read permissions
4. Your customer subdomain is provided in the Stream dashboard

## Important Notes

- All `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables are exposed to the browser
- Keep your `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` secure (server-side only)
- The Cloudflare variables are required for video upload and playback features
- Without Cloudflare configuration, video features will fall back to basic HTML5 video

## Testing Your Configuration

After setting up environment variables in Vercel:

1. Trigger a new deployment
2. Check the build logs for any missing variable warnings
3. Test video features on the deployed site
4. Verify Supabase connectivity in the live scoring features
